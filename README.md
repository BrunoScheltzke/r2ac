This is the source code for a blockchain prototype, designed to run on IoT devices.

It was wrote in Python 2.7

Dependencies:
- pyCrypto

The key folder is just a bunch of random public and private keys created for tests purpose.


TODO List:
- implement an consensus algorithm
- improve the REST methods
- auto-generate the keys (for test purpouses only)
- instrumentalize code and parametrize its time collect
- change the info genesis block hash to point to the block header hash
